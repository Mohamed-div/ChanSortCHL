About ChanSort
--------------
ChanSort is a PC application that allows you to reorder your TV's channel list.  
Most modern TVs can transfer channel lists via USB stick, which you can plug into your PC.  
ChanSort supports [file formats from numerious brands](#supported-tv-models) and can copy program numbers and
favorites from one file to another, even between different models and brands.

Features

- Use another channel list as a reference to apply the same ordering
- Multi-selection for editing multiple channels at once
- Single-list view (showing assigned channels first and then all unassigned channels)
- Side-by-side view of new/sorted list and original/complete list (similar to playlist and library)
- Rename or delete channels
- Manage favorites, parental lock, channel skipping (when zapping), channel hiding
- User interface in English, German, Spanish, Turkish, Portuguese, Russian and Romanian
- Unicode character support for channel names (Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, ...)

NOT supported:
- adding new transponders or channels
- changing tuner related properties of channels (ONID, TSID, SID, frequency, APID, VPID, ...)

Some features may not be available on all TV models and channel types (analog, digital, sat, cable, ...)

! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !
------------------------
Most of this software was written without support from TV manufacturers or access to any official 
documentation about the file formats. It is solely based on analysing existing data files, trial and error.
There is a chance of unwanted side-effects or even damage to your TV, as reported in 2 cases.

Hisense is the only manufacturer who provided technical information and a test device.
